                        <p>
                            Boombox is the ultimate 80â€™s musical experience aimed at achieving a mix of nostalgia and modern design. The focus on the user experience is the main driving factor and is evident in the users ability to make playlists, search for relevant artists, listen to tracks from each year, and connect with the community.

                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>There are music apps that cover a broad spectrum of music throughout the years, but there aren't any that cover a specific era in music. The 80's is a defining generation in music and deserves its own platform for those that want to relive the thrill of the decade. </p>
                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal is to connect users to 80's music like never before. From those who know every lyric, to those just discovering the electrifying hits of the 80's, Boombox is designed around community engagement to drive the brands recognition as a reliable source for the most far out tunes.   </p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process for delectable was broken down into different phases that ultimately led to the final design. The initial stages involved heavy research on competititors to gain a better understanding of the market. In addition, user interviews, low-fidelity prototypes, and preference tests were used to bring cohesion to the project. Each stage of the process highlighted the importance of going through this process step by step.  </p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>In terms of a competitive analysis, Nike Training Club, Gymshark, & Planet Fitness were the main competitors in the market. Nike Training Club and Gymshark are workout based apps that supply workouts, programs, and coaches to follow, while Planet Fitness has a clean layout with similar features to Nike Training Club & Gymshark, however the functionality differs slightly.  </p>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>The style of the 80's largely consisted of bright, energetic colors. The dark mode theme fit the essence of the 80's the most and allow these colors to shine on the screen. In addition, the font for the title,Porter Sans Block, grabs the attention of the user and was similar to images found in my research. Furthermore, Inter was chosen for its readability and versatility, making this a good choice for headers and the body copy. Last, the name Boombox is relevant to the 80's because of trend of people carrying around boomboxes during the 80's to jame out to their favorite music. Boombox capture the essence of the 80's the moment the login screen appears.  </p>

                Test out the app from start to finsh with this interactive prototype. It covers the same user flows addressed in the user test section and brings the app to life in real time.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Since this was my first project, it gave me some confidence and momentum going foward after everything was said and done. The process of designing an app became more clear to me with the creation of Boombox. For instance, the amount of research needed to develop the usability and also a sound design were among the key takeaways. The ability to take criticism was a critical component that I had to learn in order to improve the design. All types of feedback were valuable because it gave me the opportunity to process things from a different view point. All in all, the creation of the first project demonstrated to me how tedious and methodical designing an app really is. </p>
