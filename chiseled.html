            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Chiseled is meant to be simple and effective. With up to date workouts and information, the objective is to make finding, tracking, & completing a workout as seamless as possible. The ability to follow coaches, view your progress overtime, and pile up trophies are designed with the intent of being user friendly. Ranging from beginner to advanced, all exercise levels are accounted, and based on your data, professional recommendations will be made to optimize your workouts.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The issue with working out is that people don't know where to look or how to start. There is a plethora of content out there, but is it all credible? Most people get overwhelmed with the amount of information in fitness or health apps and ultimately give up on their goal.  </p>
        </div>
       
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The solution is to create a user friendly experience and take the guesswork out of exercising. With the primary focus on fitness, users know that Chiseled will supply up to date workouts, programs, classes, and challenges from world class coaches to help them chisel out their dream body. </p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process is broken down into 5 different phases and is the blueprint in how Bookmark was developed. The first step I employed was to gather as much research on the current market for book apps to define the target audience. Interviews were conducted which led to the development of 3 user personas and the user flow. The users were given 3 separate tasks to complete via prototypes and the final design was completed after gathering feedback to deliver the final product. </p>

                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                 <p>In terms of a competitive analysis, Nike Training Club, Gymshark, & Planet Fitness were the main competitors in the market. Nike Training Club and Gymshark are workout based apps that supply workouts, programs, and coaches to follow, while Planet Fitness has a clean layout with similar features to Nike Training Club & Gymshark, however the functionality differs slightly.  </p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Among the key takeaways, the most important has to be the readability and functionality of the interface. In the early part of the user tests, a majority of users mentioned the font being too small in certain areas. This is a key takeaway because it may look fine to me, but the user is the one who is ultimately using the app and needs to be accommodated for in every step of the process. Furthermore, another takeaway is to make sure the user knows when the desired task to be completed is finished. At times, users were confused with the end of a user flow and did not understand what the last screen of the user flow was asking them to do. The entire experience should be easy and flow seamlessly from start to finish, so users do not get frustrated and quit using the app altogether.</p>
