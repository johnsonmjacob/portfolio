            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The issue with where to find books has become more evident. With the current market, most products offer e-books, audio books, or hardcover or paperback options. There are hardly any platforms that offer all three. </p>
        </div>
       
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal with Bookmark is to give the user the option to purchase and save whatever their preferred method of reading is to create a reliable, easy to use application and expand their knowledge to new heights. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process is broken down into 5 different phases and is the blueprint in how Bookmark was developed. The first step I employed was to gather as much research on the current market for book apps to define the target audience. Interviews were conducted which led to the development of 3 user personas and the user flow. The users were given 3 separate tasks to complete via prototypes and the final design was completed after gathering feedback to deliver the final product. </p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>The competitive analysis is a key part of the research, for it brings to life what works and what doesnt work with other applications on the market. Most apps that have books available do not offer all platforms for purchasing a book, and some are for reviewing the book only. The three main competitors analyzed were Barnes & Noble, Fable, and Goodreads. </p>

                Among the 5 testers, 2 were Android users and 3 were iPhone users. The prototypes gave users little to no trouble , and as a result, minor adjustments were made to help the overall flow. The tasks were to onboard properly, schedule a workout, & complete a workout.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Among the key takeaways, the most important has to be the readability and functionality of the interface. In the early part of the user tests, a majority of users mentioned the font being too small in certain areas. This is a key takeaway because it may look fine to me, but the user is the one who is ultimately using the app and needs to be accommodated for in every step of the process. Furthermore, another takeaway is to make sure the user knows when the desired task to be completed is finished. At times, users were confused with the end of a user flow and did not understand what the last screen of the user flow was asking them to do. The entire experience should be easy and flow seamlessly from start to finish, so users do not get frustrated and quit using the app altogether.</p>
