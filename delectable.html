            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Delectable is a responsive recipe app made to take the guesswork out of finding & enjoying recipes. Eating healthy is a challenging endeavor, and with Delectable, the goal is to help you stay on track with your meals and create a customizable experience that makes cooking enjoyable. 
                </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>There are a myriad of issues with recipe apps and some of the most common ones revolve around the overwhelming experience of finding recipes for different scenarios. The ingredients tend to be insanely expensive or they are not available locally. Furthermore, lets say that you found the perfect recipe, but the reviews are terrible, and the instructions are nearly impossible to understand. To make things even worse, sometimes the instructions are at the bottom of a never ending story about the recipe.   </p>
        </div>
       
        <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The first step towards solving the problem is to simplify the filter process to guide users towards finding their desired recipe for any occasion. That also includes further information about the ingredients, so users can make a more informed decision about their diets. In terms of the frustrations with finding the actual recipe, the user will have the ability to easily jump from different sections of the recipe and include the ingredients, instructions, and reviews. The main goal is to create a memorable, easy to use interface that solves the users needs. </p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process is broken down into 5 different phases and is the blueprint in how Bookmark was developed. The first step I employed was to gather as much research on the current market for book apps to define the target audience. Interviews were conducted which led to the development of 3 user personas and the user flow. The users were given 3 separate tasks to complete via prototypes and the final design was completed after gathering feedback to deliver the final product. </p>

            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p>
                The user personas were created with three different age groups in mind to cover a wide age range. Each person is at a different stage in life and has a unique perspective on how a reliable, easy to use recipe app would be of use in their busy lives.

            <h2>Preference Test</h2>
            <p>
                The preference test altered the design & overall flow of the process due to  the results. Originally, I designed this screen & two others with the structure of the screen on the right. Out of 12 participants, all 12 chose the screen on the   left. The users noted the layout of the screen on the left was much more appealing. It was not my original idea & it goes to show how ideas evolve over time based on user feedback.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The biggest takeway for this project is how challenging responsive design can be at times. The different breakpoints make spacing and sizing a critical component to the evolution of the design. A mobile first approach is another takeaway because it was emphaized in the project brief, and it made it sense while putting it intio practice. This project made me cognizant of breakpoints and to keep them in mind while designing. </p>
